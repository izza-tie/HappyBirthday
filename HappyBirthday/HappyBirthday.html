      <p>Hi Jaja,</p>

      <p>Happy 17th Birthday! 🎉</p>

      <p>I know we only got to talk for a short time, but I just wanted to wish you a really good day — one that helps you remember how much you've accomplished and how much more you can accomplish. You have always been someone that I saw as having so much potential and motivation, and I sincerely hope that you continue to do the things that bring you to life.</p>

      <p>Even in that short time we had, you made an impact — one that I honestly didn’t expect. And for that, I really want to thank you. You might not know it, because during those times, hindi na tayo nag-uusap, but you helped me with something important. Whenever I remember it, and that feeling of regret hits me, I replay the words you said to me that afternoon in my head.</p>

      <p>It feels a bit awkward to actually send you one of the letters I’ve been writing all this time, but well... there’s no harm in trying, right?</p>

      <p>I’ve been planning to give you a little gift for your birthday ever since I found out when it was.<br>
    How did I find out? From your ML account — weird, I know. Sorry 😅</p>

     <p>I remember you once mentioned that you were considering taking computer engineering (if I remember correctly). So, I thought this would be a fitting gift. I just worked on it whenever I found some free time — nothing big, just something I wanted to make for you.</p>

     <p>I’m sorry if the design looks a bit plain — I’m not really good with art or design 😅.<br>
    I tried to make the cake look like a cheesecake, pero mas nagmukha siyang pinagpatong-patong na pancake.<br>
    And as for the coding part, my skills aren’t that great either — I didn’t really pay attention in our IT subjects back in Junior High.<br>
    Well… you got me wishing I did.</p>

     <p>I’ve been thinking about how things ended. It was just supposed to be a friendly interaction, but I somehow failed to play my role.<br>
    I wish I hadn’t suggested that you block me back then.<br>
    It wasn’t because I wanted distance — I was just embarrassed and afraid that you might find me annoying for the following days, so I tried to handle it first before it even became a problem — pinangunahan ko na.</p>

     <p>Looking back, that was a mistake, and I’m really sorry for it.<br>
    I never meant for things to turn out that way.</p>

     <p>I’m not here to make things complicated or bring up the past — I just wanted to reach out again, genuinely.</p>
